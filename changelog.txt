Changelog

v 0.2
------
+Original version number when modifications began.

v 0.2.1
------
+Added AI refuelling capabilities
+Throttle animation based on throttle position
+Higher-res livery
+damage.nas installed (currently always-on, will be switchable in later versions)
+Nasal file restructure

v1.0 - Enhanced Edition
----------------------
MAJOR SYSTEM OVERHAUL:
- Complete rewrite of engine systems with authentic J58 turbo-ramjet simulation
- Automatic turbo-ramjet transition above Mach 2.2 at 40,000+ ft
- Enhanced inlet spike control system with automatic positioning
- Realistic Compressor Inlet Temperature (CIT) monitoring with 427Â°C limit
- Advanced fuel management with automatic center of gravity control
- Climb-dive procedure automation for transonic acceleration
- Flight envelope protection with unstart prevention
- Enhanced aerodynamics with inlet efficiency effects
- Comprehensive cockpit instrumentation upgrade
- System health monitoring and status displays
- Realistic performance characteristics based on declassified data

NEW FEATURES:
- Inlet spike position indicators and manual override
- Turbo-ramjet mode status and bypass ratio displays
- CIT gauges for both engines with warning systems
- Fuel transfer automation and CG management
- Engine unstart protection and automatic restart
- Mach limit enforcement with pilot override
- Enhanced flight dynamics for all speed regimes
- Authentic operational procedures implementation

IMPROVED SYSTEMS:
- J58 engine model with altitude-dependent performance
- Realistic fuel consumption curves for JP-7
- Enhanced drag characteristics with ramjet efficiency
- Proper fuel sequencing across all tanks
- Smooth inlet spike movement with kinematic delays
- Advanced flight envelope monitoring

v 0.2.2
------
+Removed speed and thrust restrictions.
+Implemented engine failure support
+CIT guage and overheating damage
+Power increased - interpolated up to mach 3.6 instead of mach 3.4.
+Max mach of 3.53 enforced - this is due to the pressure wave from the nose of the aircraft hitting the inlets, causing an unstart.
+BigTail variant introduced
+Custom sounds by @swampmo
+Fuel system now sequences as described in the manual.
+Landing gear now is on the ground when it appears to be, instead of floating in the air when taking off. (@NikolaiVChr helped immensely in this.)
